# NS Delete Shortcodes Plugin

License: GPLv2 or later

This plugin provides an admin tool to remove shortcodes from the post content. It will actually *delete the shortcode*, not just make it output nothing.

== Description ==

This plugin only works for Administrator users, and is intended for people who know what they are doing. It can be used to delete accicentally content you didn't want deleted. Please make a back-up before using it.

It will remove shortcodes both enclosing and self-closing, but not the content of an enclosing shortcode.

If it removes something accidentally, you can always recover the previous post revision to get the original content with shortcodes.
